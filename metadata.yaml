description: Science fiction luminary H. Beam Piper was fascinated with the idea of
  time travel, and it is a theme that appears frequently in his work. This early short
  story tells the tale of a wounded soldier who awakes after suffering a profound
  injury on the battlefield. Though he can remember everything about his life as an
  adult, he has somehow been transported back into his childhood body.
